The developed game simulates a survival situation between the predator and the prey. Both need to eat at least 1 to survive, and 2 if the want to have a child. The time stablished to achieve these goals is customizable, and once it's over, only those who have eatten are pushed to the next generation. 

In this game the generations are uniparental, so there's no genetic combination between parents. However the childs have a mutation range so they can be completly different to the parent.

## Getting Started
When the game starts, the button First Generation must be clicked to generate the first generation. Once the time is over, you may click Next Generation. From this moment, we can advance generations with that button every time Time's up.
